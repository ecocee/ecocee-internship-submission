# Ecocee Internship Submission Repository

This repository is used to evaluate candidates for the Ecocee internship program.

## Important
This is NOT a certificate-based internship.
This is NOT a guided training program.
This IS real-world, self-driven engineering work.

## Instructions
1. Use this repository as a template
2. Complete ONE assigned mini-task
3. Make at least 3 meaningful commits
4. Fill `submission.json` honestly
5. Share ONLY the raw `submission.json` link

## Rules
- AI tools are allowed, blind usage is not
- Single commit = rejection
- Inability to explain code = rejection
- Mismatch between JSON and repo = rejection

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code clarity
- Commit discipline
- Problem understanding
- Ability to explain decisions
